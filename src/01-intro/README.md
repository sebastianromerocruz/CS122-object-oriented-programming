## Hello, Professor!

Hey, my name is Sebastián Romero Cruz, and I will be your instructor for this semester's **Computer Programming II: _Object-Oriented Programming_** class. It's a pleasure meeting some of you for the first time, and it warms my heart to see others again from last semester. Y'all already know how it is, so let's get started. If you are reading these notes, you'll know that I spent a good chunk of time talking about the syllabus, so please refer to that.

There's nothing too much that I want to say about myself that concerns this course too much. Here's some useless data about me, in case you're interested:

- I was born in Mexico City, Mexico.
- I have BSc in chemical engineering (I don't know why, to be honest) and a MSc in computer science, both from NYU.
- I've been teaching programming at various university levels since 2020.
- Outside of programming, I like reading novels, listening and playing music, and watching slice-of-life anime.

Alright, with that out of the way, let's start off simple this week–nothing too crazy.
